# BoomWisdomDivision Progress Tracking

## Project Status: Planning Phase Complete

### Current Phase: Pre-Development
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Date**: January 6, 2025

### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Analyzed project requirements and design mockup
2. ✅ Researched and selected Quotable API as primary quote source
3. ✅ Created comprehensive development plan with 5 phases
4. ✅ Set up GitHub repository: https://github.com/okhan1980/BoomWisdomDivision
5. ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with development workflow and API details
6. ✅ Created this progress tracking document
7. ✅ Created PROJECT_INTEGRITY_RULES.md with comprehensive quality guidelines
8. ✅ Created PHASE_1_DETAILED_PLAN.md with specific implementation details
9. ✅ Created TASK_AGENT_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md for parallel development strategy
10. ✅ Enhanced CLAUDE.md with critical project rules and quality gates

### Key Decisions Made:
- **API Choice**: Quotable API (free, 180 req/min, no auth)
- **Architecture**: MVVM with Repository Pattern
- **Tech Stack**: Compose, Hilt, Retrofit, Room
- **Min SDK**: Will lower from 34 to 26 in Phase 1
- **Development Approach**: 5 phases with PR reviews
- **Quality Standards**: Detekt for static analysis, 80%+ test coverage
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing
- **Package Structure**: Clean architecture with clear layer separation

### API Research Summary:
- **Selected**: Quotable API
  - Pros: Free, generous rate limits, no auth required
  - Cons: 125 char limit on quotes (may need to handle)
- **Alternative**: ZenQuotes (if longer quotes needed)
- **Rejected**: Quotes.rest (too restrictive free tier)

### Next Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation & Core Architecture
**Planned Start**: Next session  
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Key Goals**:
- Set up all dependencies
- Implement core architecture
- Create data models and API interface
- Set up Room database
- Basic theme system

### Repository Information:
- **GitHub URL**: https://github.com/okhan1980/BoomWisdomDivision
- **Initial Commit**: 7e7d22d
- **Branch Strategy**: feature/phase-X branches → main via PR

## Session Notes

### Session 1 - January 6, 2025
- Set up initial project structure
- Completed comprehensive planning
- Researched and selected APIs
- Created all planning documentation
- Implemented phase rotation system
- Ready to begin Phase 1 development

**Key Implementation**:
- Created `PHASE_ROTATION_PROTOCOL.md` for phase management
- Implemented `phase-rotate.sh` script for automated transitions
- Rotated to Phase 1 - `CURRENT_PHASE_PLAN.md` now active
- CLAUDE.md updated to always reference current phase

**Next Session Todo**:
1. Start Phase 1 development using `CURRENT_PHASE_PLAN.md`
2. Deploy Task agents for parallel work
3. Focus on dependency setup and architecture

**Phase Rotation Note**:
After completing Phase 1, run: `./phase-rotate.sh 1 2`
This will archive Phase 1 and activate Phase 2 plan.
