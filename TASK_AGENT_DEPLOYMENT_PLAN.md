1. Create perspective transformation logic
2. Build monitor frame composable
3. Implement scan line effect
4. Add rounded corners with clip
5. Create text perspective rendering
```

### Agent 2: Screen Layout & Navigation
**Scope**: Main screen structure
```
Tasks:
1. Create screen package structure
2. Build header with logo and labels
3. Implement golden base with star button
4. Set up Navigation Compose
5. Lock orientation to portrait
```

### Agent 3: Theme & Styling
**Scope**: Custom theme implementation
```
Tasks:
1. Update Color.kt with brand colors
2. Configure monospace typography
3. Create reusable styled components
4. Implement edge-to-edge display
5. Hide system bars appropriately
```

## Phase 3 Task Agent Deployment

### Agent 1: Quote Management
**Scope**: Quote fetching and caching
```
Tasks:
1. Implement MainViewModel
2. Create quote pre-fetching logic
3. Build offline fallback system
4. Handle loading/error states
5. Implement retry with exponential backoff
```

### Agent 2: Animation System
**Scope**: All app animations
```
Tasks:
1. Quote transition animation (1.5s)
2. Screen brightness overlay effect
3. Star button press animation
4. Golden glow pulsing effect
5. Bookmark icon animation
```

### Agent 3: State Management
**Scope**: App state and persistence
```
Tasks:
1. Implement bookmark toggle logic
2. Save/restore last viewed quote
3. Handle configuration changes
4. Create StateFlow for UI state
5. Implement error recovery
```

## Phase 4 Task Agent Deployment

### Agent 1: Favorites Screen
**Scope**: Complete favorites functionality
```
Tasks:
1. Create FavoritesScreen composable
2. Design quote list items
3. Implement swipe-to-delete
4. Add empty state UI
5. Create smooth navigation
```

### Agent 2: Polish & UX
**Scope**: User experience enhancements
```
Tasks:
1. Add haptic feedback
2. Fine-tune animation timing
3. Implement loading shimmers
4. Add pull-to-refresh
5. Create onboarding hints
```

### Agent 3: Performance Optimization
**Scope**: App performance
```
Tasks:
1. Profile and optimize animations
2. Implement baseline profiles
3. Optimize database queries
4. Reduce APK size
5. Memory leak analysis
```

## Coordination Strategy

### 1. Task Independence
- Each agent works on independent module/feature
- Minimize cross-agent dependencies
- Use interfaces for integration points

### 2. Integration Points
```
Phase 1: Repository interface connects agents 2 & 3
Phase 2: Theme module used by all UI agents
Phase 3: ViewModel connects to UI components
Phase 4: Navigation connects all screens
```

### 3. Communication Protocol
- Agents document their interfaces first
- Create stub implementations for testing
- Regular sync points at 25%, 50%, 75% completion

### 4. Conflict Resolution
- Package structure defined upfront
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Integration tests at phase end

## Agent Instructions Template

```
You are a specialized Android developer working on [SPECIFIC AREA].

Your tasks:
1. [Task 1 with acceptance criteria]
2. [Task 2 with acceptance criteria]
...

Constraints:
- Follow package structure in PROJECT_INTEGRITY_RULES.md
- Use only approved dependencies from libs.versions.toml
- Write tests for all public APIs
- Follow Detekt rules

Integration points:
- Your code will interface with [OTHER COMPONENTS]
- Expose these APIs: [LIST OF INTERFACES]
- Depend on these APIs: [LIST OF DEPENDENCIES]

Do not:
- Modify code outside your scope
- Add dependencies without version catalog
- Skip writing tests
- Create circular dependencies
```

## Success Metrics

### Phase Completion Criteria
1. All agents complete their tasks
2. Integration tests pass
3. No merge conflicts
4. Detekt analysis clean
5. 80%+ test coverage in scope

### Quality Indicators
- Clean architecture boundaries maintained
- No TODOs in committed code
- All public APIs documented
- Memory leaks: 0
- Lint warnings: 0

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Issues
1. **Dependency conflicts**: Use version catalog
2. **Integration failures**: Test interfaces early
3. **Scope creep**: Stick to assigned tasks
4. **Performance issues**: Profile continuously

### Rollback Strategy
- Each agent works in isolated branches
- Frequent commits with clear messages
- Integration branch separate from main
- Can revert individual agent work

## Phase 1 Specific Deployment

When starting Phase 1:
```bash
# Create branches
git checkout -b feature/phase-1-integration
git checkout -b feature/phase-1-dependencies
git checkout -b feature/phase-1-data-layer
git checkout -b feature/phase-1-domain-layer
git checkout -b feature/phase-1-testing
```

Deploy all 4 agents simultaneously with their specific instructions from this document.
